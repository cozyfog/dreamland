A RPG Game I'm working on,
The goal is to use the least libraries possible.
Currently I am using some simple libraries, but that's for my sanity.

## libraries
- win32 (windows platform layer) -> NECESSARY
- (glew)[https://glew.sourceforge.net] (opengl)
- (stb-image)[https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h] (image loading)
- (miniaudio)[https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio] (audio)
